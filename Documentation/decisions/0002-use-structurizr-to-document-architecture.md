# 2. Use Structurizr to document architecture

Date: 2023-03-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To maintain an overview of the project and ensure it can be handed over to a different team we need to clearly document our architecture, context and deployments.
This should be done in a way that is easily editable and updatable and doesn't require much manual work to maintain.

## Decision

We will do this using Structurizr in a graph-as-code way.

## Consequences

Architecture designs will be easily recorded and kept up to date.
Changing the architecture won't require extensive documentation updates.
