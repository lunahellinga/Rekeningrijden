### Choosing OSM

[Map features - OpenStreetMap Wiki. (n.d.).]

After carefully evaluating various options for datasets containing roads for European countries, we decided to choose
OpenStreetMap (OSM) as their primary data source. This decision was based on several key factors:

1. Availability: OSM stood out due to its wide availability and coverage for many European countries. The team found
   that OSM provides a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset that could be obtained without any significant barriers.

2. Costs: One of the significant advantages of OSM was its cost-effectiveness. The data provided by OSM is freely
   available, enabling the team to access and utilize the dataset without incurring any financial costs. This aspect was
   particularly beneficial for the project's budget and resource allocation.

3. Available Data and Attributes: OSM's dataset encompassed crucial information that aligned with the requirements of
   the Rekeningrijden microservice project. The team found that OSM provided not only road types but also additional
   attributes such as speed limits, one-way streets, and other relevant details needed for route generation and
   simulation. This richness of data allowed for more accurate and realistic traffic modeling.

4. Familiarity within the Team: The team members had prior experience and familiarity with OSM, making it a natural
   choice. This familiarity meant that the team already possessed knowledge and expertise in working with OSM data,
   reducing the learning curve and enabling faster integration into their project workflow. Leveraging existing
   expertise ensured efficient utilization of resources and smoother implementation.

Considering the combination of OSM's availability of relevant data such as road types, lack of financial cost, and the
team's familiarity, in addition to its open-source nature, it was concluded that OSM was the most suitable dataset for
generating routes and simulating traffic for the project.
