Our research project focused on implementing road pricing for European countries. We chose OSM as the dataset, designed
the tracker data transmission approach, defined the data format, and devised a scalable solution for route
transformation. Although we modified our scalability approach to three Routers instead of a complex grid-based system,
we ensured seamless integration with neighboring countries and efficient processing of routes within our region.

Throughout our research, we made pragmatic decisions to balance project requirements, available resources, and time
constraints, enabling us to develop a functional and effective solution for the Rekeningrijden microservice.
